# ðŸ“š LaTeX-Cookbook

This repository contains a custom LaTeX-based system for compiling a beautifully formatted cookbook from modular recipe files.

Each recipe is written in its own `.tex` file and assembled into a complete PDF cookbook using GitHub Actions.

---

## ðŸ“– How It Works

- Recipes are written as individual `.tex` files in the `recipes/` folder using a custom `recipebook` document class.
- The `main.tex` file assembles everything using `\input`.
- PDF builds are automated with GitHub Actions (`build-pdf.yml`).
- Artifacts like processed images and class files are managed and uploaded via workflows.
- The final PDF is automatically released using `release.yml`.
