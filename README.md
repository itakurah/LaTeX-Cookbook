**LaTeX-Cookbook** is a modular LaTeX template for creating beautifully formatted cookbooks from individual recipe files.  
Each recipe is written as its own `.tex` file and compiled into a full PDF using GitHub Actions.

Ideal for food bloggers, home chefs, and LaTeX enthusiasts ‚Äî now also available to use directly on [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/latex-cookbook-modular-latex-cookbook-template/xxhmjsbxbdyg).

## üîß Compilation Requirement

This cookbook must be compiled using XeLaTeX, not pdflatex, in order to:

- Support Unicode characters
- Use system fonts
- Ensure proper layout as defined by the recipebook class

---

## üåê Language Settings

You can set the main language of your cookbook in the `recipebook.cfg` file:

```latex
% recipebook.cfg
% Set the main language of the cookbook.
% Change this to 'german', 'french', 'spanish', etc. to localize labels and babel.
\newcommand{\recipebooklang}{german}
```
> [!NOTE]
> Currently, English, German, French and Spanish are supported. More languages may be added in future updates.

## üìñ How It Works

1. Recipes are created as individual `.tex` files inside the `recipes/` folder, using the custom `recipebook` document class that defines the cookbook's layout and style.  
2. The `main.tex` file assembles all content using `\input`, including the title page, table of contents, and individual recipes.  
3. Images are automatically scaled and cropped by the LaTeX `recipebook` class to fit the A4 page layout, ensuring consistent and professional formatting.  
4. The `build-pdf.yml` GitHub Actions workflow compiles the LaTeX source files into a formatted PDF.  
5. The `release.yml` workflow creates a new GitHub Release and uploads the final PDF as a downloadable artifact.

## üßë‚Äçüç≥ How to Add a New Recipe

Each recipe lives in its own `.tex` file inside the `recipes/` directory.

### üìÑ Example: `recipes/SpaghettiBolognese.tex`

```latex
\setRecipeMeta{Spaghetti Bolognese}{4 servings}{15 min}{45 min}{./images/SpaghettiBolognese}

\begin{recipe}
  \begin{ingredients}
    \ingredient{400g spaghetti}
    \ingredientGroup{Sauce}
    \ingredient{2 tbsp olive oil}
    \ingredient{1 onion, chopped}
    \ingredient{2 garlic cloves, minced}
    \ingredient{400g ground beef}
    \ingredient{400g canned tomatoes}
    \ingredient{Salt and pepper to taste}
    \ingredient{Fresh basil, chopped}
  \end{ingredients}
  \begin{steps}
    \step{Cook the spaghetti according to package instructions. Drain and set aside.}
    \step{Heat olive oil in a pan. Saut√© onion and garlic until translucent.}
    \step{Add ground beef and cook until browned.}
    \step{Stir in tomatoes, salt, and pepper. Simmer for 30 minutes.}
    \step{Serve sauce over spaghetti and garnish with basil.}
  \end{steps}
\end{recipe}
```
> [!TIP]
> You can use `\ingredientGroup{Sauce}` to organize ingredients into logical subgroups within the ingredients block.

### üì∑ Required Image

Each recipe **must** include an accompanying image file (e.g., `.jpg`, `.png`) placed in the `/images/` directory.

For example, for `recipes/SpaghettiBolognese.tex`, you should place the image at `images/SpaghettiBolognese.jpg`

> [!WARNING]
> **The image filename must match the path provided in** `\setRecipeMeta{...}{...}{...}{...}{./images/SpaghettiBolognese}`  

### üß© Include the Recipe in the Book

Add your new recipe to `main.tex` using `\input`:

```latex
\documentclass{recipebook}

\begin{document}
  \input{titlepage}
  \input{toc}
  \input{recipes/SpaghettiBolognese}
\end{document}
```
