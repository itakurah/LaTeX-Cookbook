# üìö LaTeX-Cookbook

This repository contains a custom LaTeX-based system for compiling a beautifully formatted cookbook from modular recipe files.

Each recipe is written in its own `.tex` file and assembled into a complete PDF cookbook using GitHub Actions.

---

## ‚úÖ Features

- Modular recipe files
- Automatic scaling and cropping of recipe images
- Automatic PDF generation via GitHub Actions
- Versioned GitHub Releases with PDF download
- Custom `recipebook` LaTeX class

---

## üìñ How It Works

1. Recipes are created as individual `.tex` files inside the `recipes/` folder, using a custom `recipebook` document class that defines the cookbook's layout and style.
2. The `main.tex` file assembles all content using `\input`, including the title page, table of contents, and individual recipes.
3. Images are automatically scaled and resized to fit the A4 page layout using the `process-images.yml` GitHub Actions workflow.
4. The `build-pdf.yml` workflow compiles the LaTeX source files and processed images into a formatted PDF.
5. The `release.yml` workflow creates a new GitHub Release and uploads the final PDF as a downloadable artifact.

## üßë‚Äçüç≥ How to Add a New Recipe

Each recipe lives in its own `.tex` file inside the `recipes/` directory.

### üìÑ Example: `recipes/SpaghettiBolognese.tex`

```latex
\setRecipeMeta{Spaghetti Bolognese}{4 servings}{15 min}{45 min}{./images/SpaghettiBolognese}

\begin{recipe}
  \begin{ingredients}
    \ingredient{400g spaghetti}
    \ingredient{2 tbsp olive oil}
    \ingredient{1 onion, chopped}
    \ingredient{2 garlic cloves, minced}
    \ingredient{400g ground beef}
    \ingredient{400g canned tomatoes}
    \ingredient{Salt and pepper to taste}
    \ingredient{Fresh basil, chopped}
  \end{ingredients}
  \begin{steps}
    \step{Cook the spaghetti according to package instructions. Drain and set aside.}
    \step{Heat olive oil in a pan. Saut√© onion and garlic until translucent.}
    \step{Add ground beef and cook until browned.}
    \step{Stir in tomatoes, salt, and pepper. Simmer for 30 minutes.}
    \step{Serve sauce over spaghetti and garnish with basil.}
  \end{steps}
\end{recipe}
```
> üì∏ **Image Tip:**  
> Place the image file `SpaghettiBolognese.jpg` (or `.png`, etc.) inside the `/images/` directory.

### üß© Include the Recipe in the Book

Open `main.tex` and add your recipe using `\input`:

```latex
\documentclass{recipebook}

\begin{document}
  \input{titlepage}
  \input{toc}
  \input{recipes/SpaghettiBolognese}
\end{document}
```
